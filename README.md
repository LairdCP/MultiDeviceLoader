Laird MultiDeviceLoader
=======================

This directory contains the source code to Laird's MultiDeviceLoader (which can be used to XCompile and download a single application to multiple same-devices in parallel on the same firmware version), written using Qt 5.4 and tested on Windows. This can be used on Linux too for loaded pre-compiled applications to devices but cannot be used to XCompile applications.
